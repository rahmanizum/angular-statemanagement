# NgRx - Starter code 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Development Server

Run
```bash
ng serve
```
for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Server for Mock Data

```bash
npm run apiServer
```

This will start a mock API server, and data will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/groceries`.
